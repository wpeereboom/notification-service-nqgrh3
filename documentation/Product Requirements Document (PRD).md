# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) specifies the requirements for developing a high-throughput, multi-channel Notification Service. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for software developers, system architects, project managers, and stakeholders involved in the implementation and maintenance of the system. It provides detailed technical specifications, architectural decisions, and implementation guidelines to ensure successful delivery of the service.

## 1.2 Scope

The Notification Service is designed to be a robust, scalable system that enables the delivery of notifications across multiple channels, including Email, SMS, Chat, and Push Notifications. The system will:

- Provide a RESTful API endpoint for notification submission
- Support multiple notification delivery vendors with round-robin load balancing
- Process hundreds of thousands of requests per minute
- Handle template-based content generation
- Templates should be multi-lingual and possible to localise
- Ensure reliable message delivery with retry mechanisms
- Track notification delivery events
- Store user preferences and notification logs

Key benefits include:

- Asynchronous processing for improved performance
- Vendor redundancy for increased reliability
- Template-based content management
- Scalable AWS-based infrastructure
- Comprehensive event tracking and monitoring
- Fault-tolerant design with graceful degradation

The service will be built using:

- AWS services (API Gateway, Lambda, SQS, RDS, SNS, EventBridge)
- PHP for backend processing
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Terraform for infrastructure deployment

- Enterprise monitoring and logging systems
- Existing user management systems for preference data

## 2.2 Product Functions

The Notification Service provides these core functions:

- Notification submission through RESTful API endpoints
- Multi-channel message delivery (Email, SMS, Chat, Push)
- Template-based content generation and management
- Vendor load balancing and failover handling
